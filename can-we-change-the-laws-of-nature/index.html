You can�t change laws without first changing human nature Picture Quotes.</p>

Nothing comes to pass in nature, which can be set down to a flaw therein;</p>

When change happens by choice we see it as an opportunity. If star trek taught us one thing, it is that “ye cannae change the laws of physics”. The reality is not so grand.</p>
