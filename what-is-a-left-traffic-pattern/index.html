Lesson 2 Maneuvers and the Traffic Pattern FLY8MA Flight Training From learn.fly8ma.com
Closed traffic − successive operations involving takeoffs and landings or low approaches where the aircraft does not exit the traffic pattern. Six segments are in a typical traffic pattern: In a standard traffic pattern, for example, all turns are made to the left and pattern altitude is 1,000 feet above ground level (agl). Usually, the pattern of traffic turns to the left and is conducted at one thousand feet above ground level (agl.) however, due to specific terrain such as mesas or large buildings,.
