Suing a mechanic for mechanic malpractice or mechanic negligence that may have resulted in an accident or injury is within the rights of the driver. If you got home safely and realized that your tire was about to fall off, then you and your mechanic will have a lot to talk about, and there is almost certainly a legal remedy for you.
